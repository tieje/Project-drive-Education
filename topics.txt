Core Philosophy
-Why a humanist perspective? Self-preservation. Plus, it makes me happy when other people are happy. Humans can only act in selfish actions (this is self-evident in that we can only ever understand the world in our own, unique minds, thus our minds are always at the center from which we make our decisions). The degree of altruism displayed by a human can be attributed to their sight: the ability to create mental models of the future. Those with high degrees of altruism are either farsighted in their mental models or feel loyal to their society. Those with low degrees of altruism are either nearsighted in their mental models or feel disloyal/apathy towards their society.
-What is a personal narrative and why use it? Personal narratives are the stories of ourselves that we tell to ourselves or to other people. When we talk about our life, we start to define certain aspects, aspects that are made only more real when talking to another person. The "Hero's Journey" or the monomyth is a cyclic journey that protagonists undertake during which they will change fundamentally upon a complete cycle. Such change is determined to be more real depending on the social constructs or people nearby that give feedback to reinforce the personal narrative's change. Otherwise, change is not inevitable and growth is hindered or stopped altogether.
-Why do you believe stories are the meaning of life? Because that's the story that I tell myself. Whatever you believe in is the story that you tell yourself. I try to be practical, but if there is no agreed upon meaning for something, I might as well define it for myself. Same goes for everyone else. Be courageous and define it for yourself. If your definition feels wrong, then change it. Be practical, flexible, and open-minded.
-Why should we propel personal narratives? There are studies that back up the claim that educating students about the growth mindset increases their capabilities, if not temporarily. The concept of the growth mindset and whoever promotes it is a catalyst for change, in which convinced students can begin their hero's journey. Tests, homework, and grades are impersonal and impartial by definition. Somehow we are to derive meaning in life while studying in pursuit of these numbers, while all they really do is cause enormous insecurity about our self-worth and our abilities. The reality is that as humans, we have incredible potential.
-How do you define success? Bliss without ignorance. This state is possible when you're working towards solving a problem. The human condition is one that is plagued with problems, but that doesn't mean we can't have fun solving them.

Pass/Fail classes
-What should be the right percentage of information to learn? The 80/20 rule is learning 80% or what's presented and appears everywhere for some mathmatical reason. We only want these required classes to fulfill the 10/90 rule, which is to solve 90% of problems with 10% of information. Look into studies about how much information can we expect for someone to learn
-Why pass/fail classes? Why not use grades? Pass/Fail reinforces that you are inherently valuable and your self-worth should not be tied to grades. Use the example of MIT students and doctors. Although not all students are multi-talented, it is worth noting that to stamp a score on a child akin to grading meat. We are multi-faceted humans, not meat. Many students implicitly make the erroneous conclusion that one's worth is related to one's grades. This fallacy is the cause of mental disorders, depression, anxiety, and even death; all of this among our nations best and brightest who should otherwise be encouraged to work on something they believe in. Everyone should have enough inherent self-worth to get started on a project.

Non-traditional Required classes
-Why these classes?
Learning how to Learn: we take it for granted that students know how to study or learn on their own. So far the child may have been tested on recognition rather than recall. Upon being tested on recall and failing, the child may decide that they are simply stupid, which is untrue. Determining effective study methods is crucial for the future of the student.

Life Design, Prototyping, Mental Health, and Relationships: Life design gives the student perspective and goals. Having a goal kickstarts the student's hero's journey. Perspective opens the student's mind to potential options. For mental health, there are a few things that we can all do to give public support of mental health, which has always been an issue, but an issue that we may nonetheless solve in a generation. Relationships are always a hot topic issue, but the main point is to be self-aware of hormones and the difference between lust and love. Kids must keep in mind that most relationships in life are temporary, but reoccuring, so don't burn your bridges.  Kids must be able to recognize an abusive relationship and to be able to determine the potential good and bad motives for actions. Finally, we must all learn what it means to be civil and why we choose to do this.

Professional Etiquette and basic computer skills: Professional etiquette serves a problem-solving purpose in the economy. The problem being communication, marketing, and relationship maintainence. Controlling our emotions, stepping back from our ego ultimately allows us to make more informed and more logical decisions rather than feeding our ego. Professionalism helps avoid overstimulation and negative emotions or interactions, which are bad for business. Negative emotions and negative interactions hold a special place in our lives and it's safest to deal with them in controlled environments and with trusted individuals. As far as basic computer skills everyone needs to know how to type, use a word processor (Word), data manipulator (Excel), data storage (Access), and very basic coding knowledge.

Communications for public speaking and persuasive writing: Communication is the heart of society. This skill is essential for project proposals. It's important for students to make a public name for themselves as some may be more talented in speaking than writing and vice versa. Those who make a name for themselves early on have an edge and establish themselves as possible social nodes of reference.

Fundamental Laws of Science and Math: The sciences can be incredibly difficult yet rewarding. The problem is that science is a vast field. To expect children to learn vast amounts of information, most of which they will never use practically, is a huge waste of time for the student, teacher, and society at large. There are a few fundamental laws and techniques that we should all know about to prevent people being scammed as well as having a comfortable understanding of the scientific method and why it works so well. This class should also a include a review of the use of science in society, industry, and academia and what these structures look like. There's a lot of meta-knowledge behind closed doors.
